# Workflow: From Issue to Merge Request

This document outlines the standardized workflow for analyzing GitLab issues, creating implementation plans, and generating merge requests with comprehensive strategic documentation.

**üîß TECHNOLOGY-AGNOSTIC WORKFLOW**: This workflow does not assume any specific programming language, framework, or build system. All project-specific commands and requirements must be documented in the project's CLAUDE.md file. This workflow focuses on analysis and planning rather than implementation details.

## Prerequisites

- Access to GitLab MCP tools for issue and merge request management
- Local development environment with testing and analysis capabilities
- Git repository with appropriate branch permissions
- Understanding of project architecture and security considerations
- **CLAUDE.md file containing project-specific build, test, and quality commands**

**IMPORTANT**: This workflow is technology-agnostic. All project-specific commands (build, test, lint) must be documented in CLAUDE.md. These workflows do not assume any particular programming language or build system.

## Workflow Steps

### 0. üîß Initial Setup & Project Context

```bash
# BASH: Check current git status and ensure clean state
git status
if [[ $(git status --porcelain) ]]; then
    echo "Warning: Uncommitted changes detected. Commit or stash before proceeding."
    git status --short
    exit 1
fi

# BASH: Ensure we're on main branch for new feature branches
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "main" && "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "master" ]]; then
    echo "Switching to main branch for new feature creation"
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
fi

# BASH: Get project information
REMOTE_URL=$(git remote get-url origin)
echo "Working with repository: $REMOTE_URL"
```

**Setup Verification Checklist:**

- [ ] Working directory is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] Currently on main/master branch for new feature start
- [ ] Latest changes pulled from remote
- [ ] Git remote URL is accessible and correct
- [ ] Development environment is ready

### 1. üìã Issue Analysis & Task Planning

```bash
# TOOL CALL: Set up project and issue identification

#   {"id": "7", "content": "Create merge request with comprehensive plan", "status": "pending", "priority": "high"}
# ]
```

### 2. üîç Issue Deep Dive & Assignment

```bash
# TOOL CALL: Get detailed issue information
# gitlab_get_issue --project_id <project_id> --issue_iid <issue_number>

# TOOL CALL: Self-assign the issue (unless specified otherwise)

2. Research related issues and documentation
3. Create draft MR with questions and assumptions
4. Tag issue author for feedback
```

#### 2. **Complex/Unclear Codebase**

```bash
# Recovery approach:
1. Use multiple analysis passes with different tools
2. Focus on entry points and main interfaces first
3. Document what you do understand
4. Note areas requiring implementer investigation
```

#### 3. **Conflicting Requirements**

```bash
# Recovery approach:
1. Document the conflicts clearly
2. Propose options with trade-offs
3. Recommend stakeholder discussion
4. Create MR highlighting decision points
```

#### 4. **Security/Performance Concerns**

```bash
# Recovery approach:
1. Err on the side of caution in recommendations
2. Clearly document risk areas
3. Suggest security review requirements
4. Recommend performance testing protocols
```
