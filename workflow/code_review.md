# Workflow: Code Review

This document outlines the standardized workflow for conducting thorough, constructive code reviews on GitLab merge requests with emphasis on line-specific comments for maximum clarity and context.

**üîß TECHNOLOGY-AGNOSTIC WORKFLOW**: This workflow does not assume any specific programming language, framework, or build system. All project-specific commands and requirements must be documented in the project's CLAUDE.md file.

## Prerequisites

- Access to GitLab MCP tools for merge request management
- Understanding of code quality principles and security best practices
- Knowledge of project architecture and coding standards
- **CLAUDE.md file containing project-specific build, test, and quality commands**

**IMPORTANT**: This workflow is technology-agnostic. All project-specific commands (build, test, lint) must be documented in CLAUDE.md.

## Workflow Steps

    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  CLAUDE.md file not found - cannot verify testing approach"
    echo "Review should include manual verification of testing strategy"
else
    # Extract test commands for verification
    TEST_CMD=$(grep -E "^\s*[-*]\s*\`.*test.*\`" CLAUDE.md | head -1 | sed -E 's/.*`([^`]+)`.*/\1/' || echo "")
    BUILD_CMD=$(grep -E "^\s*[-*]\s*\`.*build.*\`" CLAUDE.md | head -1 | sed -E 's/.*`([^`]+)`.*/\1/' || echo "")
    
    echo "Project test command: $TEST_CMD"

### 6. üí¨ Line-Specific Feedback Creation

Never mention that feedback was generated by AI.

```bash
# TOOL CALL: Create targeted line-specific discussions for issues found
# gitlab_create_merge_request_discussion \
#   --project_id <project_id> \
#   --merge_request_iid <mr_iid> \
#   --body "<constructive_feedback_message>" \
#   --position {
#     "base_sha": "<base_sha_from_mr>",
#     "head_sha": "<head_sha_from_mr>", 
#     "start_sha": "<start_sha_from_mr>",
#     "old_path": "<file_path>",
#     "new_path": "<file_path>",
#     "position_type": "text",
#     "new_line": <line_number>,
#     "old_line": null
#   }
```

**Line-Specific Comment Guidelines:**

#### When to Use Line-Specific Comments:

- **Code Quality Issues**: Specific improvements for readability/maintainability
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Exact locations of security concerns
- **Performance Problems**: Specific inefficient code sections
- **Logic Errors**: Precise algorithmic or business logic issues
- **Convention Violations**: Exact deviations from coding standards
- **Bug Fixes**: Specific corrections needed

#### Comment Quality Standards:

1. **Be Specific**: Reference exact code elements
2. **Be Constructive**: Suggest improvements, not just problems
3. **Provide Context**: Explain why the change is needed
4. **Include Examples**: Show preferred alternatives when possible
5. **Be Respectful**: Maintain professional, collaborative tone

#### Example Comment Templates:

**Security Issue:**
```
üîí **Security Concern**: This input is not properly validated.

**Issue**: User input is directly used in database query without sanitization.
**Risk**: SQL injection vulnerability
**Suggestion**: Use parameterized queries or input validation library.

Example:
```sql
-- Instead of: query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + userInput
-- Use: query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?" with prepared statements
```

**Performance Issue:**
```
‚ö° **Performance Optimization**: This loop could be optimized.

**Issue**: O(n¬≤) complexity due to nested iteration
**Impact**: Performance will degrade significantly with larger datasets
**Suggestion**: Consider using a hash map for O(n) lookup time.

Example:
```
// Create lookup map outside the loop
const lookup = new Map(items.map(item => [item.id, item]));
// Then use: lookup.get(targetId) instead of items.find()
```

**Code Quality:**
```
üìù **Code Quality**: Consider extracting this logic into a separate function.

**Issue**: Complex logic embedded in larger function reduces readability
**Benefit**: Improved testability and reusability
**Suggestion**: Extract to `<suggested_function_name>()` with clear parameters.
```

### 7. üìä Overall Assessment & Summary

```bash
# TOOL CALL: Create comprehensive summary comment
# gitlab_create_merge_request_note \
#   --project_id <project_id> \
