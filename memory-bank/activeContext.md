# Active Context: GitLab MCP Server

## Current Focus
The current development focus has been on finalizing the implementation of the GitLab MCP server capabilities across three key areas:

1. **Project Settings Management**: Implemented tools for managing project integrations and webhooks, with a primary focus on CRUD operations for triggers and Slack integration
2. **CI/CD Settings Support**: Added capabilities to interact with GitLab CI/CD configuration, including pipeline triggers, variables, and runners
3. **User and Group Management**: Implemented tools to manage users, groups, and permissions

Most recently, we focused on fixing TypeScript compilation errors to ensure the project builds successfully. This included addressing type safety issues in webhook management and pipeline trigger operations.

## Recent Changes
- Fixed TypeScript errors related to webhook options in `gitlab_add_webhook` and `gitlab_update_webhook` operations
- Added proper validation for required URL parameters in webhook operations
- Fixed type casting for pipeline variables in `gitlab_trigger_pipeline` operation
- Completed implementation of the handler functions in the main `index.ts` file for all tools
- Organized code into domain-specific manager classes for better maintainability
- Successfully verified the build process with no errors

## Active Decisions

### Type Safety Improvements
- Added explicit validation for required parameters before API calls
- Implemented proper type casting for API parameters to match expected interfaces
- Added error handling for missing required parameters
- Updated webhook handling to ensure proper type safety

### Tool Selection
The implementation now includes a comprehensive set of GitLab operations:
- Core repository operations (projects, branches, merge requests, issues, files)
- Project integrations management (webhooks, Slack integration)
- CI/CD configuration (pipeline triggers, variables, runners)
- User and group management (users, groups, permissions)

### API Access Patterns
- Using personal access tokens for authentication
- Supporting both GitLab.com and self-hosted instances
- Implementing proper error handling for API failures
- Using domain manager classes to organize related functionality

### Code Organization
- Separating functionality into domain-specific manager classes:
  - `IntegrationsManager`: Handles project integrations and webhooks
  - `CiCdManager`: Manages CI/CD pipelines, variables, and triggers
  - `UsersGroupsManager`: Handles user and group administration
- Using TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Implementing consistent error handling across all API calls

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
1. Continue refining type safety throughout the codebase
2. Add support for pagination in list operations
3. Implement unit tests for all tools
4. Create comprehensive documentation for all tools

### Medium-term Goals
1. Expand tool set to cover more GitLab API endpoints
2. Implement caching for improved performance
3. Add support for webhook callbacks
4. Create helper functions for common operations

### Long-term Vision
1. Support for GitLab GraphQL API
2. Support for advanced authentication methods
3. Implementation of resource streaming for large files
4. Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment

## Open Questions
1. How to handle GitLab API rate limiting effectively?
2. What's the best approach for handling large repository files?
3. How to structure more complex GitLab operations that require multiple API calls?
4. What additional metadata should be provided to AI assistants for better context?

## Current Challenges
1. Ensuring consistent type safety across all GitLab API interactions
2. Managing GitLab API token security
3. Supporting various GitLab API versions and endpoints
4. Handling large responses efficiently within MCP protocol constraints
