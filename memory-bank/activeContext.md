# Active Context: GitLab MCP Server

## Current Focus
The current development focus has been on finalizing the implementation of the GitLab MCP server capabilities across three key areas:

1. **Project Settings Management**: Implemented tools for managing project integrations and webhooks, with a primary focus on CRUD operations for triggers and Slack integration
2. **CI/CD Settings Support**: Added capabilities to interact with GitLab CI/CD configuration, including pipeline triggers, variables, and runners
3. **User and Group Management**: Implemented tools to manage users, groups, and permissions

Most recently, we focused on fixing an issue where many tools weren't visible to the AI assistant. This included:
1. Adding missing tool definitions in the tools-data.ts file for the integration, CI/CD, and users/groups tools
2. Properly categorizing the tool definitions using array slicing for better organization
3. Ensuring all tools registered in the tool registry have corresponding definitions

## Recent Changes
- Added two new tools for enhanced GitLab merge request management:
  - `gitlab_update_merge_request`: Enables updating the title and description of merge requests
  - `gitlab_create_merge_request_note_internal`: Adds support for internal notes (only visible to project members)
- Updated tool registry to include the new handlers
- Added tool definitions with proper schemas and validation
- Updated repository tools category to include the new tools
- Successfully built and tested the new functionality
- Fixed a critical issue where the tool definitions were incomplete, causing many tools to be invisible to the AI assistant
- Added missing tool definitions for all integration, CI/CD, and users/groups tools that were already implemented in handlers
- Updated the category-specific tool exports to use proper array slicing for organization
- Fixed the mismatch between the tool registry and the tool definitions
- Updated the @modelcontextprotocol/sdk dependency to version 1.7.0 to support the latest protocol features
- Fixed server initialization to properly configure capabilities for tools and resources
- Implemented the correct structure for tools and resources capabilities using the { listChanged: false } format
- Resolved "Server does not support tools" and "Server does not support resources" errors
- Removed problematic registerCapabilities call that caused type errors
- Successfully compiled the project with no TypeScript errors

## Active Decisions

### Complete Tool Definitions
- Updated the tool definitions in tools-data.ts to include all tools that were already implemented in the handlers
- Used consistent schema patterns across all tool definitions 
- Maintained proper type definition for complex parameter types like pipeline variables
- Ensured required fields are properly marked for each tool

### Server Initialization Pattern
- Updated the server initialization to properly configure tools and resources capabilities
- Followed the correct structure for capability objects according to the MCP SDK 1.7.0 requirements
- Maintained the existing pattern for server setup while ensuring compatibility with the newer SDK

### Code Reorganization
- Implemented a modular file structure with domain-specific managers:
  - `IntegrationsManager`: Handles project integrations and webhooks
  - `CiCdManager`: Manages CI/CD pipelines, variables, and triggers
  - `UsersGroupsManager`: Handles user and group administration
- Created a tool registry that maps tool names to their handler functions
- Extracted resource handlers into a separate utility module
- Used consistent patterns for error handling and API access

### Type Safety Improvements
- Added explicit validation for required parameters before API calls
- Implemented proper type casting for API parameters to match expected interfaces
- Added error handling for missing required parameters
- Updated transport configuration to follow SDK patterns
- Ensured proper typing for server initialization and startup

### Tool Selection
The implementation now includes a comprehensive set of GitLab operations:
- Core repository operations (projects, branches, merge requests, issues, files)
- Project integrations management (webhooks, Slack integration)
- CI/CD configuration (pipeline triggers, variables, runners)
- User and group management (users, groups, permissions)

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
1. Continue refining type safety throughout the codebase
2. Add support for pagination in list operations
3. Implement unit tests for all tools
4. Create comprehensive documentation for all tools
5. Add support for updating merge request approvals and labels

### Medium-term Goals
1. Expand tool set to cover more GitLab API endpoints
2. Implement caching for improved performance
3. Add support for webhook callbacks
4. Create helper functions for common operations

### Long-term Vision
1. Support for GitLab GraphQL API
2. Support for advanced authentication methods
3. Implementation of resource streaming for large files
4. Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment

## Open Questions
1. How to handle GitLab API rate limiting effectively?
2. What's the best approach for handling large repository files?
3. How to structure more complex GitLab operations that require multiple API calls?
4. What additional metadata should be provided to AI assistants for better context?

## Current Challenges
1. Ensuring consistent type safety across all GitLab API interactions
2. Managing GitLab API token security
3. Supporting various GitLab API versions and endpoints
4. Handling large responses efficiently within MCP protocol constraints
